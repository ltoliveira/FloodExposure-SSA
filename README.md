# Flood Exposure in Sub-Saharan African Cities

Repository of scripts (Jupyter notebooks) and respective data used in the article "Exposed yet unmapped? Evidence of differential flood exposure in deprived urban areas using citizen science". 
Here we provide a series of codes with the following purposes:
1) 1_Grid_Creation: create 50x50 grid 
2) 2_GIS_GridProcessing: integrate the flood exposure elements (flood hazard + elements at risk) to the grid
3) 3_Processing: process the dataset above, merge, clean up, analyse input
4) define built-up density thresholds
5) calculate and analyse flood exposure
6) compute a hit-and-miss evaluation: statistical comparison of simulated and observed flood points at community level
7) run the thematic analysis of reported flood impacts (from community survey)
   
## Requirements
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries are described in each script

## Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the notebook step by step

## Outputs
1) integrate the flood exposure elements (flood hazard + elements at risk) 
2) process the dataset above (all case studies)
3) define built-up density thresholds
4) calculate and analyse flood exposure
6) compute a hit-and-miss evaluation: statistical comparison of simulated and observed flood points at community level
7) run the thematic analysis of reported flood impacts (from community survey)
